This code was last tested using Ruby 2.6.10.

To run the code, use the command `ruby xortag.rb` in the current directory. Ruby must be installed and in the path for this to work.

If you don't have Ruby installed but have Docker installed, you can run the code with the following command: `docker run --rm -it -w /app -v ${PWD}:/app ruby:2.6.10 ruby xortag.rb`.
