This code was last tested using .NET 6.0.402.

To run the code, use the command `dotnet run` in the current directory. .NET 6.0 SDK must be installed and in the path for this to work.

If you don't have .NET installed but have Docker installed, you can run the code with the following command: `docker run --rm -it -w /app -v ${PWD}:/app mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 dotnet run`.
