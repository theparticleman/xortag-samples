This code was last tested using PHP 8.1.26.

To run the code, use the command `php xortag.php` in the current directory. PHP must be installed and in the path for this to work.

If you don't have PHP installed but have Docker installed, you can run the code with the following command: `docker run --rm -it -w /app -v ${PWD}:/app php:8.1-alpine sh`.
